# CaCS_cement_hydration_dynamic
Open-source Python implementation of a two-channel kinetic model for CaCO₃-assisted cement hydration. It consumes GEMS-exported aqueous activities (aᵢ), converts them into ionic activity products, saturation ratios, and then integrates CSH nucleation/growth (channel A) and C3A systems with competitive adsorption &amp; internal partition (channel B).
